resto is a STAC catalog and a search engine dedicated to geospatialized data. Originally, itâ€™s main purpose it to handle Earth Observation satellite imagery but it can be used to store any kind of metadata localized in time and space.

resto search API conforms to the [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification v1.1.0](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec)

# Installation

## TL;DR
The [INSTALLATION.md](./docs/INSTALLATION.md) file provides additional information on the installation process.

## Deploy the service
To launch a default pre-configured resto instance, just type :

    ./deploy

This will build locally the jjrom/resto image and launch a resto container exposing the resto API service at **http://localhost:5252**

To launch a default develop resto instance (i.e. with RESTO_DEBUG set to true and all database logs), just type :

    ./deploy -e config-dev.env

To launch a default develop resto instance using a connection pooling, just type :

    ./deploy -e config-dev-pgbouncer.env

### [IMPORTANT] Docker on Mac M1
If you're using docker on Mac with apple Silicon M1 chip, be sure to **turn off "Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon"** in Docker Desktop > Settings > General.

When this option is turned on, every calls to PHP preg_match function (which is used by resto) leads to a segmentation fault within php fpm and an HTTP 502 Bad Gateway error in nginx. Why ? I just don't know !
