resto is a metadata catalog and a search engine dedicated to geospatialized data. Originally, itâ€™s main purpose it to handle Earth Observation satellite imagery but it can be used to store any kind of metadata localized in time and space.

resto search API conforms to the [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification v1.0.0](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) and to the [CEOS OpenSearch Best Practice Document](http://ceos.org/ourwork/workinggroups/wgiss/access/opensearch/).

It is mentioned in ESA's "Exploitation Platform Common Core Components" as the closest implementation of a catalogue component according to the requirements specified in ESA's ["Exploitation Platform Open Architecture"](https://tep.eo.esa.int/news/-/blogs/exploitation-platforms-open-architecture-released)

## Demo

The [https://tamn.snapplanet.io] resto server provides up to date access to Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images.

You can browse it with the [rocket web client](https://rocket.snapplanet.io)

Or test the API :

* Get STAC root endpoint - https://tamn.snapplanet.io/?_pretty=1
* Get all collections - https://tamn.snapplanet.io/collections?_pretty=1
* Search Sentinel-2 products acquired on June 1st, 2021 - https://tamn.snapplanet.io/collections/S2/items?datetime=2021-05-06T00:00:00/2021-06-01T23:59:59&_pretty=1
* Get catalogs of products classified by continents - https://tamn.snapplanet.io/catalogs/classifications/geographical/continent?_pretty=1
* Get catalogs of products classified by european countries - https://tamn.snapplanet.io/catalogs/classifications/geographical/continent/continent:Europe:6255148?_pretty=1

# Quick startup

## Deploy the service
To launch a default pre-configured resto instance, just type :

    ./deploy

This will build locally the jjrom/resto image and launch a resto container exposing the resto API service at **http://localhost:5252**

### [IMPORTANT] Docker on Mac M1
If you're using docker on Mac with apple Silicon M1 chip, be sure to **turn off "Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon"** in Docker Desktop > Settings > General.

When this option is turned on, every calls to PHP preg_match function (which is used by resto) leads to a segmentation fault within php fpm and an HTTP 502 Bad Gateway error in nginx. Why ? I just don't know !

## Ingest a collection
To ingest a collection using the default **ADMIN_USER_NAME** and **ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD** (see [config.env](config.env)) :

        # POST a S2 dummy collection
        curl -X POST -d@examples/collections/S2.json "http://admin:admin@localhost:5252/collections"

Then get the collections list :

        curl "http://localhost:5252/collections"

## Ingest a feature
To ingest a feature using the default **ADMIN_USER_NAME** and **ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD** (see [config.env](config.env)) :

        # POST a dummy feature inside the S2 collection
        curl -X POST -d@examples/features/S2A_MSIL1C_20190611T160901_N0207_R140_T23XMD_20190611T193040.json "http://admin:admin@localhost:5252/collections/S2/items"

        # Update a dummy feature inside the S2 collection
        curl -X PUT -d@examples/features/testUpdate.json "http://admin:admin@localhost:5252/collections/S2/items/S2A_MSIL1C_20190611T160901_N0207_R140_T23XMD_20190611T193040"

Then get the feature :

        curl "http://localhost:5252/collections/S2/items/S2A_MSIL1C_20190611T160901_N0207_R140_T23XMD_20190611T193040"
